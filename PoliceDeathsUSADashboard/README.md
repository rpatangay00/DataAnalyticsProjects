## Summary of Dashboard

Being a resident of Texas, my curiosity led me to delve into the police officer death data specifically for my home state. As I explored the US Police Deaths Dashboard, I uncovered insightful patterns that shed light on the challenges faced by law enforcement officers here. The bar chart swiftly caught my attention, showcasing that Texas bears the unfortunate distinction of having the highest number of overall police deaths among all states. The gravity of this fact emphasizes the demanding nature of law enforcement duties in our state. As I turned my attention to the line chart, it was intriguing to observe that 1926 and 1972 stood out as years with notably higher police death rates in Texas. These spikes piqued my curiosity, urging me to explore historical events that may have influenced these trends. The pie chart, on the other hand, provided a poignant visual representation of the causes behind police deaths in Texas. The dominant prevalence of gunfire-related deaths raises awareness about the inherent risks officers face while on duty. Equally significant, the presence of automobile accidents serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable hazards that officers encounter.
